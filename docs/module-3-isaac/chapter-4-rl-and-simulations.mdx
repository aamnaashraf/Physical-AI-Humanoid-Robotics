# Reinforcement Learning & Simulation

<LearningObjectives objectives={frontMatter.learning_objectives} />

**Reinforcement Learning (RL)** allows robots to learn complex behaviors by interacting with their environment. Isaac Sim provides a safe, high-fidelity environment for training RL policies before deploying them on physical robots.

## Key Concepts

1. **RL Basics**
   - **Agent**: The robot being trained  
   - **Environment**: The simulation or real-world scenario  
   - **State**: Current observation of the environment  
   - **Action**: Robot commands (e.g., joint velocities, wheel speeds)  
   - **Reward**: Feedback for desired or undesired outcomes  

2. **Policy**
   - A function mapping states to actions  
   - Can be deterministic or stochastic  

3. **Value Functions**
   - Estimate expected rewards for states or actions  
   - Used in policy optimization  

4. **Reward Shaping**
   - Design rewards to encourage desired behaviors  
   - Include penalties for unsafe or inefficient actions

## Training RL Policies in Isaac Sim

1. **Set Up Simulation Environment**
   - Use photorealistic environments and realistic physics  
   - Include sensors (camera, LiDAR, IMU) for perception  

2. **Define Reward Function**
   - Example: +10 for reaching goal, -1 for collisions  
   - Use dense rewards for faster learning  

3. **Select RL Algorithm**
   - Popular choices: PPO, DDPG, SAC  
   - Use stable-baselines3 or Isaac Gym RL API  

4. **Train the Agent**
   - Run multiple episodes in simulation  
   - Monitor cumulative reward and policy convergence  

5. **Evaluate Policies**
   - Test trained agent in unseen environments  
   - Check for stability, robustness, and safe behaviors

## Integration with Navigation & Perception

- Connect RL agent output to **motion controllers**  
- Use perception modules for state estimation  
- Fine-tune reward signals based on actual navigation performance  

---

## Best Practices

- Start training with simple tasks before scaling complexity  
- Log metrics and visualize agent behavior for debugging  
- Save and checkpoint policies regularly  
- Combine simulation data with real-world testing for robust deployment  

---

## Summary

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Train reinforcement learning policies in Isaac Sim  
- Design reward functions for desired behaviors  
- Integrate learned policies with navigation and perception pipelines  
- Evaluate and refine autonomous robot behaviors in simulation
