# Navigation Stacks & Integration

<LearningObjectives objectives={frontMatter.learning_objectives} />

Navigation is a critical component for autonomous robots. In this chapter, we focus on **deploying and integrating ROS 2 navigation stacks**, specifically **Nav2**, within Isaac Sim and real-world scenarios.

## Key Concepts

1. **Nav2 Overview**
   - Provides full navigation pipeline: localization, planning, control  
   - Works with 2D LiDAR, IMU, and odometry sensors  
   - Supports modular configuration for different robot platforms  

2. **Localization**
   - Use **AMCL (Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization)** for real-time pose estimation  
   - Tune particle filter parameters for accuracy  

3. **Mapping**
   - Build static or dynamic occupancy grids using simulated sensors  
   - Use SLAM-based maps for unknown environments

## Integration Steps

1. **Configure Robot Description**
   - Ensure URDF/Xacro matches simulated or real robot  
   - Define sensor frames and joints for Nav2  

2. **Launch Navigation Stack**
   ```bash
   ros2 launch nav2_bringup navigation_launch.py
