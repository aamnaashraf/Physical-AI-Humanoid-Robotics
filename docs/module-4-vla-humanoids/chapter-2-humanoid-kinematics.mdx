# Humanoid Kinematics Basics

<LearningObjectives objectives={frontMatter.learning_objectives} />

Humanoid robots rely heavily on **kinematics** to perform precise movements. Kinematics deals with the geometry of motion without considering the forces causing it.

## Key Concepts

### Forward Kinematics
- Calculates the position of the robot’s end-effector given joint angles
- Uses **Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters** for limb modeling
- Useful for **simulation and visualization**  

> 💡 **Tip:** Forward kinematics is deterministic: joint angles → position of limb.

### Inverse Kinematics
- Determines the joint angles required to reach a desired position
- Often requires iterative solvers or numerical methods
- Critical for **motion planning and task execution**  

> ⚠️ **Note:** Multiple solutions may exist; constraints and joint limits must be respected.

### Joint Constraints
- Each joint has a **range of motion**  
- Limits prevent mechanical damage and ensure safe operation  
- Must be considered during trajectory planning
