# Manipulation Primitives

Manipulation primitives are **basic building blocks** of humanoid robot actions. They allow robots to **pick, place, grasp, and interact** with objects in the environment.

---

## Key Concepts

### Pick-and-Place
- Move the robot arm to approach an object  
- Grasp the object securely  
- Move object to the target location  
- Release safely  

> **💡 Tip:** Always define safe trajectories to avoid collisions and joint limits.

### Grasp Primitives
- **Top-down grasp:** Grasping objects from above  
- **Side grasp:** Lateral approach for wider objects  
- **Power grasp:** Entire hand wraps around the object  
- **Precision grasp:** Only fingertips touch the object  

> **📝 Pro Tip:** Visualize contact points in simulation to optimize grip.

## Motion Planning for Manipulation

1. Define start and goal positions for the end-effector  
2. Use inverse kinematics to compute joint angles  
3. Plan trajectory considering obstacles and joint limits  
4. Execute movement in simulation first  

> **⚠️ Caution:** Always check collision detection before deploying on a real robot.

## Example Workflow: Pick a Cube

1. **Perception:** Detect cube using camera and depth sensors  
2. **Planning:** Compute IK solution and trajectory  
3. **Execution:** Move arm and close gripper  
4. **Place:** Move to target location and open gripper  
5. **Verification:** Confirm cube is correctly placed  

> **💡 Fun Fact:** Robots can learn to improve grasping over time using reinforcement learning!

## Advanced Strategies

- **Adaptive Grasping:** Adjust grip based on object size and weight  
- **Sequential Manipulation:** Perform multiple pick-and-place tasks efficiently  
- **Bimanual Manipulation:** Use both arms for complex tasks  

> **📦 Hackathon Idea:** Combine perception + RL + manipulation primitives to create a **robot bartender** that serves drinks autonomously!

---

## Testing in Isaac Sim

- Simulate objects of different shapes and weights  
- Monitor joint limits and collisions  
- Test grasp success rate and adjust control parameters  

> **📝 Tip:** Logging trajectories helps debug failures and improve planning.

## Summary

After this chapter, you will be able to:

- Implement basic pick-and-place and grasp actions  
- Plan safe trajectories for manipulation  
- Use simulation to validate robot behaviors  
- Apply advanced strategies for efficient manipulation
