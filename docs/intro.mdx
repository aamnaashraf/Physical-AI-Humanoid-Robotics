# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

<LearningObjectives objectives={frontMatter.learning_objectives} />

Welcome to the **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — Hackathon Edition**.  
This version of the course focuses on **practical, hands-on robotics skills** you’ll need for building a working humanoid system within a limited timeframe.

## What is Physical AI?

**Physical AI** refers to artificial intelligence that goes beyond the screen and interacts with the real world. Unlike traditional AI models that operate only on data, Physical AI connects **sensing, reasoning, and robot actions** through:

- **Perception** – Cameras, LiDAR, depth sensors, voice input  
- **Planning** – Deciding *what to do next* in a dynamic world  
- **Action** – Motors, actuators, and manipulation tasks  
- **Learning** – Improving performance from experience or data  

These four components form the backbone of your upcoming hackathon tasks.

## Course Overview

This Hackathon Edition compresses the original 13-week curriculum into a **rapid, targeted learning journey**, preparing you for real-world humanoid robotics challenges.

### Weeks 1–2: Foundations
- Overview of Physical AI and robotics pipeline  
- Hardware setup (Workstation, Edge Kit, or Cloud Simulation)  
- Environment configuration and productivity tools  

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (Weeks 3–5)
Master **ROS 2**, the communication backbone of modern robots.  
You'll build nodes, topics, services, and URDF models used in humanoids.

### Module 2: Digital Twins (Weeks 6–7)
Use **Gazebo** and **Unity** to develop digital replicas of your robot.  
Simulations help you test hackathon tasks faster and safely.

### Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac (Weeks 8–10)
Implement perception and navigation pipelines using **Isaac Sim**, including:
- VSLAM  
- 3D perception  
- Basic navigation  

### Module 4: VLA & Humanoids (Weeks 11–13)
Integrate **Vision-Language-Action models** to control humanoid robots.  
You’ll work with:
- Kinematics  
- Manipulation tasks  
- Voice/LLM-based control  

### Week 13: Capstone / Hackathon Build
Construct a simplified humanoid workflow:  
**Voice Input → Plan → Navigate → Perceive → Manipulate**

## Who This Course Is For

This edition is ideal for:
