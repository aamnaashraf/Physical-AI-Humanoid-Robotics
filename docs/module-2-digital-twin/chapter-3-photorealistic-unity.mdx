# Photorealistic Sensors with Unity

Simulation fidelity is crucial for developing and testing robotics algorithms.  
Unity allows creating **photorealistic virtual environments** with high-quality lighting, materials, and sensor models.

---

## Why Photorealistic Sensors?

- Reduce the gap between simulation and real-world deployment  
- Generate realistic camera images for perception models  
- Test algorithms under variable lighting and environmental conditions  
- Produce synthetic datasets for AI training

## Types of Sensors Simulated in Unity

### **1. RGB Cameras**
- Capture high-resolution images of the environment  
- Apply realistic lighting and shadows  
- Useful for computer vision, object detection, and SLAM  

### **2. Depth Cameras**
- Provide per-pixel distance measurements  
- Combine with RGB for RGB-D data  
- Important for 3D reconstruction and obstacle avoidance  

### **3. LiDAR**
- Simulate laser scanning with configurable resolution and noise  
- Generate 3D point clouds similar to real sensors  

### **4. IMU & Force Sensors**
- Simulate robot orientation and forces for control and navigation  
- Helps validate motion planning under physical constraints

## Integrating Unity with Robotics Pipelines

- Unity scenes can be synchronized with **ROS 2** or **Isaac Sim**  
- Simulate sensor streams in real-time for algorithm testing  
- Export synthetic datasets for perception AI models
