# From Simulation to Real Robot

<LearningObjectives objectives={frontMatter.learning_objectives} />

Simulation provides a safe environment to test algorithms, but the ultimate goal is **real-world deployment**. This chapter focuses on bridging the gap between virtual environments and actual robotic hardware.

## Bridging Simulation to Hardware

Key steps to transition from simulation to real robots:

1. **Export Control Commands**  
   - Map simulated actuators and joints to real hardware interfaces  
   - Ensure units and scales match between simulation and robot  

2. **Validate Sensor Pipelines**  
   - Test cameras, LiDAR, and IMU data streams on the real robot  
   - Calibrate sensors to account for real-world noise and drift  

3. **Motion Planning & Safety**  
   - Test trajectories in simulation first  
   - Use soft limits and collision checking to prevent hardware damage  

4. **Integration with ROS 2 or Control Software**  
   - Ensure communication nodes match the simulated environment  
   - Verify message timing, topic names, and parameter configurations

## Common Challenges

- **Simulation-Real Gap**: Differences in dynamics, friction, or sensor noise  
- **Hardware Limitations**: Actuator speed, torque limits, and mechanical compliance  
- **Unexpected Interactions**: Environmental factors that were not simulated

## Best Practices

- Start with small, simple motions before full autonomy  
- Incrementally test sensor integration  
- Keep logs and compare simulated vs. real-world data  
- Use modular control pipelines to minimize risks
