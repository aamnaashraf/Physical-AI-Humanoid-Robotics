# Simulation Basics

Simulation is the foundation of Digital Twin development.  
Before running robots in the real world, engineers test their **motion**, **sensors**, and **environment interactions** safely inside a virtual environment.

Robotics simulation enables faster development, reduces hardware risks, and supports repeatable experiments.

## Why Simulation Matters

Humanoid and mobile robots operate in complex environments. Simulation helps you:

- Test navigation & perception algorithms  
- Validate robot movements without causing hardware damage  
- Experiment with new ideas quickly  
- Reproduce tests with consistent conditions  
- Generate synthetic training data for AI models

## Core Elements of a Robotics Simulation

### **1. 3D Environment**
A realistic virtual world containing:
- Objects  
- Obstacles  
- Surfaces  
- Lighting  

These elements mimic the physical surroundings where the robot operates.

---

### **2. Robot Model**
A simulated representation of the real robot including:
- Joints & links  
- Sensors  
- Actuator limits  
- Collision geometry  

In this module, we will work with **URDF/SDFormat** robot models.

---

### **3. Physics Engine**
The engine ensures the world behaves realistically by simulating:
- Gravity  
- Friction  
- Collisions  
- Dynamics & inertia  

Common physics engines:
- **Gazebo Classic / Ignition**  
- **NVIDIA PhysX** (used in Isaac Sim)  

---

### **4. Sensors**
Simulation platforms provide realistic sensor models for:
- RGB & Depth cameras  
- LiDAR  
- IMU  
- Force/Torque sensors  

These are crucial for training perception and control algorithms.
